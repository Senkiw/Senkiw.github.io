# Personal Portfolio 

## HOW
I created my web portfolio using a simple structure of a one page scrolling site, with navigation that jumps down to each section.  I used a combination of Flexbox and Grids for the layout, some simple Javascript to import a photo gallery and create a back to top button, and some simple CSS animations for movement/interest.
I came across a few challenges with my animations and my responsiveness - I orignally had my UX design images scale up on mobile but I had issues with tablet and desktop.  I chose to remove this transformation, because it was not necessary and I provided links to the designs anyway for a larger view.  I chose to implement a one page site but did not want a sticky navigaiton.  To resolve the fact that someone would have to scroll all the way to the top to get back there I implements a back to top button that appears when the person scrolls.  With Javascript I set it so that it would be hidden until scrolling, and then the function would simply bring the page to the top.


## WHY 
I chose to add some CSS animations to a few things like the logo in the nav, and portrait to simply add some interest so the site didn't seem so static.  I chose to keep the UX design layout the same across all sizes because I felt that it fit well and the links provide a more indepth view anyway.  The photo layout could be improved, I plan to alter it with Bootstrap to create a lightbox that expands the photos. (or if I get better I may code it with Javascript myself).  I chose to not implement any Bootstrap for this project because I've used Bootstrap before and it makes things nice and easy - I wanted to do all the coding for this project :)
My contact page I chose to omit some things from my original design to keep it clean.  I also did not want to put my email on a public site and would rather be contacted through the form.  I didn't include any social media links here because they're directly below in the footer and I feel that it is redundant.  I'd rather clean than cluttered.
I plan to use this site to show my work.  I will likely use it for photography/design, so the dynamically loaded image gallery is really useful as I can easily update that information without going into my HTML file.  

## WHAT
While making this project I learned how to create a back to top button within Javascript and I discovered how CSS transitions effect other browser sizes.
