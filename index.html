              <p class="lead">Dressed in a striking costume, his hair dyed reddish-brown, Bowie launched his Ziggy Stardust stage show with <cite>the Spiders from Mars</cite>.  It was hugely popular, catapulting him to stardom as he toured the UK over the next six months and creating, a &#34;cult of Bowie&#34; that was &#34;unique-its influence lasted longer and has been more creative than perhaps almost any other force within pop fandom.&#34;</p>  
              <!--WANT TO COLLAPSE-->
              <p>Bowie's love of acting led his total immersion in the characters he created for his music.  Acting the same role over an extended period however, it became impossible for him to seperate Ziggy from his own character offstage.</p>

              <p>Considered one of Bowie's bet albums, it's been described by Stephen Erlewin as &#34;a kaleidoscopic array of pop styles, tied together only by Bowie's sense of vision: a sweeping, cinematic melange of high and low art, ambiguous sexuality, kitsch, and class.&#34;</p>

              <p>His eighth studio album, <cite>Diamond Dogs</cite> was a marriage of the novel <cite>Nineteen Eighty-Four</cite> and Bowies own glam-tinged vision of a post-apocalypic world.  Bowie wanted to make a theatrical production of Orwell's book, but the author's estate denied the rights. The song's he wrote wound up on this album.</p>

              <p>This album contains three of Bowie's most successful singles: <cite>Let's Dance</cite>, <cite>Modern Love</cite>, and <cite>China Girl</cite>.  It was Bowie's best selling album, selling 10.7 million copies worldwide.

              <p>One of Bowie's better-selling albums, it was poorly received by fans and critics, who often regard the mid-to-late 1980s as a low point of creativity and musical integrity for Bowie.  In support of the album, he went on the <cite>Glass Spider Tour</cite> that was at that point the biggest, most theatrical and elaborate tour he had undertaken in his career.</p>
